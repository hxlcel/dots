# Hazel's NixOS Configuration files <3

For your own good and sanity, don't use my files as an example.
They are the abhorrent offspring of unhealthy hyperfixation, 
poor decisions, hubris, and irrational sentimentality. 

What does work only does so because either:
1. I have blatantly copy-pasted it from elsewhere.
2. I have bruteforced it with pure trial and error.

## Hyprland
Configured using [Hyprnix](https://github.com/hyprland-community/hyprnix) (mostly). 

## Neovim
- Neovim configuration based on lazy.nvim.
- Relies on system-wide LSPs & formatters.

## Multihost
- All of my NixOS systems are managed via the one set of dotfiles and nix flakes.
